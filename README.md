Applying various machine learning algorithms for regression 

- The task is to apply regression techniques to predict the mortality rate due to cancer. 
- Evaluating and comparing the results of all models.

The techiniques used are :
  1. KNN Regressor
  2. Linear Regression
  3. Ridge 
  4. Lasso
  5. Support Vector Machines (kernel = rbf, poly, linear)
  6. Decision Tree
